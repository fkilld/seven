Sure! Here's a clear breakdown of **URL parameters** and **query strings**, along with examples.

---

### ✅ Basic URL Structure

```
https://example.com/page?key=value
```

* `https://example.com/page` → base URL
* `?key=value` → query string
* `key=value` → a query parameter (or URL parameter)
* Multiple parameters are separated by `&`

---

### 🔍 Query Parameters: Examples

These are typically used to **pass data to the server**, such as filters, searches, or identifiers.

#### 🧪 Example 1: Search

```
https://example.com/search?q=chatgpt
```

* `q=chatgpt` → Search query is "chatgpt"

#### 🧪 Example 2: Pagination

```
https://example.com/posts?page=2&limit=10
```

* `page=2` → Page number 2
* `limit=10` → 10 results per page

#### 🧪 Example 3: Filtering Products

```
https://store.com/products?category=shoes&color=black&sort=price_asc
```

* `category=shoes` → Filter by shoes
* `color=black` → Filter by black color
* `sort=price_asc` → Sort by price (ascending)

---

### 📌 Path Parameters vs. Query Parameters

Sometimes URLs use **path parameters** instead of queries:

```
https://example.com/users/12345
```

* `12345` is a **path parameter**, identifying the user.

Compare that to a query version:

```
https://example.com/users?id=12345
```

* `id=12345` is a **query parameter**

---

### 🧹 URL with Anchor (Fragment)

```
https://example.com/page?id=456#section2
```

* `id=456` → query parameter
* `#section2` → anchor (not sent to server, used by browser)
